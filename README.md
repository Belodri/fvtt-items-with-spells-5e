This module aims to allow users to attach spells to items in such a way that when the parent item is added to an actor, the spells attached come with, pre-configured with consumption overrides and other small QOL changes.

It also adds a new display of spell-attached items to the Spellbook.

## Features

This module does not replace or augment any core item workflow logic, only allows a way to signify that some Items also add spells to actors when added to an actor.

The scope of this module is intentionally limited and will not fully replace the edge-cases that Magic Items attempts to accommodate.

## Compatibility

Compatible with:
- Actions List 5e

Uncertain Compatiblity with:
- Magic Items
